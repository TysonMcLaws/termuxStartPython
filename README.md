# termuxStartPython
I am testing my abilities.  This script will help you get important stuff on Termux Android and maybe any Linux.

My idea is that you download control.sh and everything else will fall into place.
The other files are on here for the program to retrieve.

In order to get termuxStartPython on your computer follow these steps:
1. Open you terminal
2. Type "apt-get install wget"
3. Type "cd" or where-ever you want this to install
4. Type "wget https://github.com/TysonMcLaws/termuxStartPython/raw/master/setup.sh"
5. Type "chmod +x setup.sh"
6. Finally, type ./setup.sh

Now whenever you want to start the program type "control.sh"
